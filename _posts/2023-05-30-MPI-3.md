In  this section, we will show how to use MPI's send and receive message functions to build up a numerical integration application.

The trapezoidal rule will be used here to estimate integral of f(x), where we divide the region into *n* trapezoids with the base $h=\frac{b-a}{n}$, the area for each trapezoid can be estimated as: $Area=\frac{1}{2}h[f(x_{i-1}+f(x_i))]$
