Most parallel systems use buffered communication. This means that the data in a message that is being sent is put into temporary storage until the receiving process calls a receive function, at which point the data is transferred into regular storage. The buffering is essential, because without buffering, the system must be synchronous which can easily cause deadlock problem. Deadlock problem is unsafe as all processes are waiting or hung, and the program will stop executing new commands.
