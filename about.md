Welcome to my website! I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), where my academic journey is deeply rooted in the captivating field of molecular dynamics simulations. My research interests span a broad spectrum from the development of polarizable force fields to the exploration of free energy calculation methods, all with the aim of advancing our understanding of the intricate behaviors of biomolecular systems.  


In this data-driven age, I've harnessed the potential of machine learning in the context of molecular dynamics, merging the power of computational biology and artificial intelligence. This exciting fusion offers an avenue for enhancing the precision and efficiency of simulations, a pioneering direction that I am eager to contribute to and help shape.  


Beyond these, my work involves the microscopic dissection of bio-systems. By delving into the nitty-gritty of life's most fundamental processes and mechanisms through the lens of physical and chemical principles, I aspire to unlock deeper insights and enrich our collective understanding of life at its most essential level.  


My dedication and intellectual curiosity drive me towards creating innovative solutions that could potentially push the boundaries of computational biology. I look forward to sharing my journey with you through this platform. Stay tuned for exciting updates and discoveries!
